# NewOCR Wiki

The NewOCR wiki is a website to give detailed information on how the OCR works, along with examples of how to use it. This website is hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and is using the Jekyll theme [Just The Docs](https://github.com/pmarsceill/just-the-docs). 

To locally build and view this website, first ruby must be installed. Uncomment the `theme:` line in `_config.yml` and then run `bundle` followed by `bundle exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_local_config.yml`.

If something should be added onto the wiki such as better descriptions, more code examples, etc. please make an issue.
