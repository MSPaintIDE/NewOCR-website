Before characters are separated a process, called line separation occurs. <src data-gh="https://github.com/MSPaintIDE/NewOCR/blob/2dcf3f19c218e233943dbaf12361f54eea8bb472/src/main/java/com/uddernetworks/newocr/recognition/OCRActions.java#L299-L340">This detects any horizontal breaks in each row, to find each line of characters from the training image.</src> <src data-gh="https://github.com/MSPaintIDE/NewOCR/blob/2dcf3f19c218e233943dbaf12361f54eea8bb472/src/main/java/com/uddernetworks/newocr/recognition/OCRActions.java#L344-L362">Sometimes characters such as the dot of an <code>i</code> or a <code>_</code> will be above or below all other characters, and will result in a separate line. This is overcome by the <src data-gh="https://github.com/MSPaintIDE/NewOCR/blob/2dcf3f19c218e233943dbaf12361f54eea8bb472/src/main/java/com/uddernetworks/newocr/train/OCROptions.java#L75"><code>OCROptions#setMaxPercentDiffToMerge(double)</code></src> method which sets a percentage of the main line's height in pixels another line must be away for it to merge, since it is most likely part of the same line.</src> This can only be done during training, as there is a known consistent format of characters/lines.
