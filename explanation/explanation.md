# Explanation

This section is dedicated to explaining the different parts of the OCR, including its goals and hopefully answer any questions revolving around API design people may have with it.

This section doesn't contain any code examples, and it only contains minimal API references, such as talking about method names. Javadocs are going to be public on the website soon.
